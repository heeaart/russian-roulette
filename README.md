### What is Russian Roulette?
Russian roulette is a dangerous game of chance that involves the use of a revolver handgun loaded with a single bullet. The game is typically played with two or more players taking turns to point the gun at their own head and pull the trigger, with the hope that the chamber in which the bullet is loaded will not be aligned with the gun's firing pin.
